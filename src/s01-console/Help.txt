<f color=green>This is an example of how to change colors using markup<f color=gray>

This is an example of writing a help file:

The console markup files are somewhat similar to HTML. They can be rendered either into
console object (coloring the output), or into HTML which is handy for WEB-consoles.

You can change <f color=magenta>colors<f color=gray>, <b color=green>spacing<b color=black>, justification

See <f color=cyan>`ConsoleUtils.WriteMarkupContent()`<f color=gray> function in Azos
